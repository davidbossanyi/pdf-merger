## Usage
_To be filled out_

## Development
The development environment should be created and managed using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To create the environment:
```commandline
uv sync --all-groups
```
To run the formatting, linting and testing:
```commandline
uv run poe all
```
Or simply
```commandline
poe all
```
if you have activated the virtual environment (VSCode will do this automatically for you). For example, to activate the environment from a PowerShell prompt:
```powershell
. ".venv\Scripts\activate.ps1"
```
